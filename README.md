# media embedding
 personal media embedding code for my server

the main point of this code was to allow embeds for images, gifs, and videos,<br> for places like twitter or discord.

everything is mostly done within javascript and pug. any of the code<br> in pug was written in html before converted.

special thanks to [nullobsi][1] and [hyperdefined][2] for writing most<br> if not all of the javascript and helping me in general
